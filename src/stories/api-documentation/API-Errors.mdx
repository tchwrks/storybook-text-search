# API Errors

API errors are the building blocks of design systems. They are used to create consistent and predictable design patterns.

## Error Types

API errors are categorized into three types:

- 400 Bad Request
- 401 Unauthorized
- 403 Forbidden
- 404 Not Found

Each controller / API route group will return one of the above error types with a context-specific message.
